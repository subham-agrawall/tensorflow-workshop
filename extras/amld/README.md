# [AMLD](https://www.appliedmldays.org) TensorFlow Workshop

This workshop was given during the Applied ML days at EPFL:

https://www.appliedmldays.org/workshop_sessions/tensorflow-basics.1

The workshop introduces basic TensorFlow concepts and contains example code to
build different estimators (canned, 2D convolutional, RNN). We use the
["Quick, Draw" dataset](quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data). The repository also
contains example code for training the models on Google's
[Cloud ML](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/).
